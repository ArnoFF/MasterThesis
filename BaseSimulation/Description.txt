SIMULATION DESCRIPTION

Functions to change values:

'Main': Script to start the simulation from. Initializes constants and vehicles. Starts the forward euler loop and creates GIF.
	  Change initial values of vehicles or create new vehicles. Change constants such as dt, sensor range, ...

'Step_function': Change mission of vehicles to specific times.



Other functions:

'FwdEuler': Calls 'step_function' every time step.

'Controller': Creates control input for a vehicle. Entails CBFs and CLFs and the QP.

'Detect_vehicles': Called in 'Controller' to detect which vehicles are on which relative position to the ego vehicle.

'unpackStruct': Called in 'Controller'. Unpacks the structure created in 'Detect_vehicles' so the data can be easily used in 'Controller'.

'lambda': Calculates the function 'lambda' and its derivatives used in CBFs. (Called in 'Controller')
